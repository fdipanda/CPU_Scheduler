# CPU Scheduling Simulator

Franck Dipanda â€” CS 3502 Section 03

## Overview

A Windows Forms application simulating six CPU scheduling algorithms:  
FCFS, SJF, SRTF, Round Robin, Priority, and HRRN.

The simulator allows users to input processes, select scheduling strategies, view CPU/memory usage, and export results to text files.

## Contributions

- Implemented SRTF and HRRN algorithms
- Added UI buttons for new algorithms
- Created automatic result exporting feature

## How to Run

1. Open `CpuSchedulingWinForms.sln` in Visual Studio
2. Build and run the project
3. Simulation reports are saved in the `/Reports` folder
